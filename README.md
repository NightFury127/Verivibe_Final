## Technical Details

VeriVibe uses a combination of advanced neural networks and machine learning algorithms to detect deepfakes. The system analyzes multiple aspects of media files including:

- Facial features and expressions
- Lighting and shadow consistency
- Pixel-level analysis
- Temporal consistency (for videos)
- Metadata analysis

## API Documentation

The system exposes the following API endpoints:

- `POST /api/detect/image` - Analyze an image
- `POST /api/detect/video` - Analyze a video
- `POST /api/detect/text` - Analyze text content
